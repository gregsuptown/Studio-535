## 0. NORTH STAR (READ THIS FIRST)

Studio 535 · Dream Forge exists at the intersection of **craftsmanship, creativity, technology, and legacy**.

We are entering a new era where people value:
- Individuality over mass production
- Craft over speed
- Meaning over disposability

Studio 535 creates **bespoke, functional works of art** — pieces meant to be used, admired, and passed down.  
Not trends. Not commodities. **Heirlooms.**

Clients do not just hire a maker.  
They gain:
- My expertise
- My creative process
- My standards
- My network of elite craftspeople
- White-glove, discreet service from concept to delivery

We are selective.  
We turn down work that does not align.  
We choose our clients as carefully as they choose us.

If they want something that still matters years from now —  
they are exactly where they should be.
